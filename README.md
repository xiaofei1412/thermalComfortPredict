# thermalComfortPredict
This is a scientific research that I participated in during the summer vacation of 2023 in Xi 'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. The project is a smart building based on digital twin technology. In this project, I was responsible for thermal comfort prediction, which was mainly completed by using some mainstream algorithms in machine learning.This experimental dataset was collected by laboratory equipment, and the model performance was evaluated using MSE method.
